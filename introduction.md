# Introduction

This document provides a step-by-step guide to setting up a virtual cybersecurity lab using
Kali Linux and Metasploitable on a virtualization platform (VMware/VirtualBox). The lab
will allow for penetration testing and cybersecurity practice.
Setting up a cybersecurity lab provides a controlled environment for ethical hacking,
penetration testing, and security research.
Kali Linux is a widely used penetration testing operating system, while Metasploitable is a
intentionally vulnerable machine designed for security testing.
By following this guide, you will learn how to install and configure these virtual machines,
establish a network for testing, and conduct basic reconnaissance to identify potential
weaknesses. This lab setup will provide hands-on experience with essential cybersecurity
tools, helping you develop practical skills in ethical hacking and security analysis.
