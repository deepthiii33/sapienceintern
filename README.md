# 🎓 Cybersecurity Internship Project — Sapience Edu Connect Pvt Ltd

## Summary

This internship project was conducted over **four weeks** as part of the **Cybersecurity Training Program** by **Sapience Edu Connect Pvt Ltd**. The curriculum included hands-on activities in setting up a cybersecurity lab, learning Linux fundamentals, network scanning, footprinting, enumeration, and ethical hacking.

The tasks were divided into weekly modules:


#### 🔹 Week 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity & Virtualization  

This task involves setting up a cybersecurity lab using **Kali Linux** and **Metasploitable** on a virtualization platform. It also covers **network configuration** and **initial reconnaissance** using tools like Nmap.

### 🛠️ **Tools Used**  
   **Virtualization Software:** VMware / VirtualBox  
   **Operating Systems:** Kali Linux, Metasploitable  
   **Networking Tools:** ifconfig, ip a  
   **Reconnaissance Tools:** Nmap
