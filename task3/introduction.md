# Introduction
- This project focuses on active network reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment using Nmap and other open-source tools.
- The objective is to understand and practice techniques for identifying live hosts, scanning open ports, enumerating running services, performing OS fingerprinting, and assessing potential vulnerabilities within a network.

- The tasks also include basic footprinting using tools like **whois, dig, and nslookup**
- Along with comparisons using tools like  **Masscan, Nikto, and zenmap**

-  Each step demonstrates practical application of commands with explanations and screenshots where applicable
-  For Nmap command assistance, help can be accessed through: **nmap --help**
