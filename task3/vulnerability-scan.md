# 8. Vulnerability Assessment

- To identify potential security vulnerabilities in the target system using Nmap's scripting engine.
- Command used : nmap --script=vuln 192.168.1.4
- --script=vuln -->  helps to find weak spots in a system that hackers might use to break in.

Can find full scan in screenshots folder(vulnerability_assessement_2)

**Main vulnerabilities found here is:**
-  The FTP service on port 21 is running vsftpd version 2.3.4, which is known to contain a backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523) that can be exploited by attackers to gain root access and run arbitrary commands.This is a critical vulnerability and should be fixed immediately.
-  Port 25 (SMTP) also has several issues related to SSL/TLS configurations. It shows vulnerabilities like Anonymous Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, which makes it possible for attackers to intercept and decrypt encrypted sessions. It also includes the Logjam attack (CVE-2015-4000), which allows an attacker to downgrade secure TLS connections to weak ones, making them easier to break.
-  Insufficient group strength in Diffie-Hellman key exchange further weakens the cryptographic security, and SSL POODLE (CVE-2014-3566) vulnerability indicates that SSL 3.0 is in use, which is considered outdated and insecure.
-  Scan also shows that the SMTP service is not vulnerable to CVE-2010-4344, meaning some configurations are secure.
-  These results highlight the need for immediate patching and disabling of insecure protocols to protect the system from potential exploits.


**The Nmap vulnerability scan effectively highlighted services with known weaknesses, offering a strong base for further exploitation or remediation steps.**
